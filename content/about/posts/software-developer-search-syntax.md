StackMuncher software developer search is still work in progress and is not very user-friendly.

This page provides examples of how to use software-specific keywords to find the person you are after. Contact us on info@stackmuncher.com if you need any help with your search.

#### Single computer language
* `java`
* `rust`
* `c++`
* `c#`
* All tracked languages are listed on [StackMuncher homepage](/)

#### Multiple computer languages
* `ruby scss javascript`
* `c# sqlclient`
* Combine up to 4 keywords

#### Database use
* `c# sql` for any flavour of SQL
* `c# mongodb` for MongoDB
* `c# sqlclient` for MS SQL, confusingly it has no 'mssql' in it because MS SQL libraries for .Net are `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` and `System.Data.SqlClient`
* Tools and framework names come from the names of libraries found in the code. Ask your engineers what libraries they use.

#### Specific technology or framework use
* `microsoft.entityframeworkcore`
* `react-native`
* The language keyword was omitted here because libraries are usually specific to a particular language.

#### Lines of code per language
* `rust:10000 c++ ruby` - minimum 10,000 lines of code in Rust, at least some code in C++ and Ruby
* `rust:10000 c++:5000 ruby` - experienced in both Rust and C++, may know some Ruby

#### Timezone availability
* `kotlin 4hrs@utc+9` - kotlin developers with at least 4 hour availability in UTC+9 (Japan, Korea)
* `java 5hrs@utc-8` - java developers with at least 5 hour availability in UTC-8 (US-West)
* Use this [interactive map](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/map/) to find your timezone.

#### Full-stack developer
* `rust:20000 typescript postgres 4hrs@utc-8` - a very experienced Rust developer with full-stack skills for US-West timezone
* `ruby javascript mysql mongodb 8hrs@utc` - a Ruby/JS developer for West Europe/UK timezone
* `java android sqlite elastic` - an Android developer with SQL/ElasticSearch experience and any timezone availability

## Open Source Software bias

The type of computer code found in public repositories is biased towards technologies used in Open Source projects. For example, there is more open source code related to MySQL and Postgres and less for MS SQL or Oracle. A developer may use C/C++ for work and Rust for open source. Consider adjacent and transferrable skills to expand your search.
