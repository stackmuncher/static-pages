## Non-judgemental metrics

No ranking, no leader-boards, no judgement on the quality or quantity of your code. We simply present the data about your skills and preferences as searchable reports.

Key metrics:

* programming languages and frameworks
* lines of code per language / framework
* depth and breadth of use
* proxies for coding style
