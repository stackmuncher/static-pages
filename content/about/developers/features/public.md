## Public profiles

Freelancers, contractors or anyone actively looking for work can add extra details such as links to social profiles or direct contact details.

Anything included in the profile is public by default. Employers can contact members with public profiles directly for free.

Never pay a fee or percentage of your earnings for finding work again.
