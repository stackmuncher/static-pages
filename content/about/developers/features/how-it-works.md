## About the project

StackMuncher was started by [@rimutaka](/rimutaka) to quantify how well he knows C# and if his coding skills can be measured without sitting a test.

* [All of StackMuncher code](https://github.com/stackmuncher), including most of the back-end is open source
* We will appreciate your help to improve and expand the code analysis part
* Internally we use Rust, VueJS and AWS
* Our database is also open source and can be downloaded from AWS S3
