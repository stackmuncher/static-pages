# Find software developers with the right skills and capabilities

#### We put developer skills, coding style and learning rate ahead of their ability to write a sleek resume.

---

Unlike resumes with unreliable self-assessments, StackMuncher directory is based on the analysis of the actual code written by the developers. 
Our open-source app checks every line of their code to extract useful metrics you can search for.

Shortlist the developers you think are a good match and we'll send them a link to your job ad or you can approach them directly.
