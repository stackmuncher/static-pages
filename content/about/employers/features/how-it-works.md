## How to attract the right software developers

Skilled devs and talented beginners already have jobs. Even if they are not actively looking, many are open to new opportunities. The best way to get their attention is to present them with an opportunity that matches their skills and interests. How do we know that? We are software developers too.

Instead of approaching someone "for a chat" or asking them to sit an online test we send developers a very concise message with your job outline and how well they match it. The better the match, the more likely they are to apply.

Our metric-based directory cuts through the noise and helps both sides engage only if there is a good fit.
