## What developers really want

Our two-way matching allows our members to specify what kind of work and benefits they are most interested in. It can be the type of employer, industry or the amount of compensation.

StackMuncher [developer search](/) takes the guesswork out of the process. It helps you zero-in on the likely candidates and informs how to adjust your offer to get better matches.
