## Non-judgemental metrics

We don't rank developers or define what a "good" developer is. We present the data about their technology stack and expertise. You choose what metrics important to you, including availability, timezone and other profile details.

Developer metrics come from [our code analysis app](https://github.com/stackmuncher/stm_app#software-developer-profile-builder) that looks at every commit they make and updates their profiles in real time.
