## Non-judgemental metrics

We don't rank developers or define what a "good" dev is. We simply present the data about their skills and coding habits. The data comes from GitHub and some of the devs run a local client that analyzes their proprietary code without us ever seeing it.

You can choose the metrics important to you, including availability, timezone and other profile details.
