## Contacting members

Developers with publicly posted contact details can be approached directly.

Some members prefer to be contacted via a private message with screening questions about your company, the team and the nature of the work.

Your job ad can be posted on your company or any other website. Anyone interested in your offer will have to follow your application process.
